This directory contains five files:

- This file, `README.md`.
- `run_analysis.R`, which is an R script that downloads the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset (UCI HAR) and generates two excerpts from it. 
- `CODEBOOK.md`, a Markdown file that describes the two excerpts generated from the UCI HAR dataset, and also the process used to generate these datasets.
- `UCI_har_excerpt.csv`, a comma separated value file containing the first excerpt created from the UCI HAR dataset.
- `UCI_har_tidy.csv`, a comma separated value file containing the second excerpt created from the UCI dataset, which contains average values for each of the columns for each activity performed by each subject.

These datasets are made available by acknowledging the license at the end of the codebook.
